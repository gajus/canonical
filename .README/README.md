Canonical code style linter and formatter for JavaScript, SCSS and CSS.

Canonical is the most comprehensive code style guide. It consists of more than [500 rules](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-config-canonical), some of which are custom written for Canonical (e.g. [`eslint-plugin-jsdoc`](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc)). The aim of Canonical is to enforce consistent code style, reduce noise in code version control and promote use of latest ES features.
